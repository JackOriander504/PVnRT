# PVnRT
### This module is mainly created to calculate this simple yet powerful physics equation.
## That is : $ Pv = nRT $
In case you don't know what it is [Click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law)

## Gist of the WIKIPEDIA Page: 
> Basically this equation states that the product of the pressure and the volume of one gram molecule of an ideal gas is equal to the product of the absolute temperature of the gas and the universal gas constant.

## Meaning of the letters used in the equation:
$$ Pv = nRT $$
$ P = $  [pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure)
<br/>
$ v = $  [volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume)
<br/>
$ n = $  [amount of substance in mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amount_of_substance)
<br/>
$ R = $  [ideal gas constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant)
<br/>
$ T = $  [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature)
